# opengithub Sitemap

Status: iteration 2 site-map pass, partial but broad. Live inspection covered the public GitHub home/navigation surface. Authenticated app structure is mapped from the scraped GitHub docs because the reusable Ever sessions were expired and the current browser context was not authenticated.

Evidence:
- Ever attempted first as required: `ever snapshot --mode full` failed with `No tab with given id`; `ever use 1 && ever snapshot --mode full` failed with `Session expired`.
- Fallback live browser capture: Chrome headless screenshot saved to `ralph/screenshots/inspect/home-sitemap.jpg`.
- Fallback live DOM capture: GitHub home page global nav/footer links extracted from `https://github.com/`.
- Docs cross-reference: `target-docs/content/account-and-profile/get-started/personal-dashboard-quickstart.md`, `target-docs/content/repositories/index.md`, `target-docs/content/issues/index.md`, `target-docs/content/pull-requests/index.md`, `target-docs/content/actions/index.md`, `target-docs/content/packages/index.md`, `target-docs/content/pages/index.md`, `target-docs/content/organizations/index.md`, `target-docs/content/search-github/index.md`, `target-docs/content/subscriptions-and-notifications/index.md`.

## Global Layout Pattern

- Public logged-out pages use a marketing header with GitHub mark, dropdown mega-nav sections, search/jump control, Sign in link, bordered Sign up button, large hero content, product sections, and dense multi-column footer.
- Signed-in pages use a compact GitHub app shell: left global navigation menu trigger, GitHub mark back to dashboard, global search/jump bar, quick-create button, Issues/Pull requests/Notifications shortcuts, and avatar menu.
- Repository pages are the core workspace. They use an owner/repo breadcrumb header, visibility badge, repository action buttons, and a horizontal tab bar for Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, and Settings.
- List pages use compact filter bars, status tabs, labels/milestones/actions links, query input, and paginated or grouped result lists.
- Settings pages use left sidebar navigation with right-column forms/cards and dangerous actions at the bottom.

## Public / Logged-Out Pages

- `/` — marketing home. Global nav, search field, sign-in/sign-up CTAs, product feature sections, customer stories, footer.
- `/login` — sign-in page inspected in iteration 1.
- `/signup` — signup page inspected in iteration 1.
- `/password_reset` — target password reset page inspected in iteration 1; excluded for opengithub while auth remains Google-only.
- `/features` — product feature index.
- `/features/actions` — Actions marketing/feature page.
- `/features/issues` — Issues/Projects marketing/feature page.
- `/features/code-review` — code review marketing/feature page.
- `/features/discussions` — Discussions marketing/feature page.
- `/features/copilot`, `/features/models`, `/features/spark`, `/mcp` — AI/product marketing pages; clone should not build these unless later scope expands.
- `/pricing`, `/enterprise`, `/team`, `/solutions`, `/resources`, `/customer-stories`, `/marketplace`, `/sponsors`, `/topics`, `/trending`, `/collections` — secondary public discovery/marketing pages. Build as low-priority static or omit from MVP unless linked from app shell.

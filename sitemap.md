# opengithub Sitemap

Status: iteration 2 site-map pass, partial but broad. Live inspection covered the public GitHub home/navigation surface. Authenticated app structure is mapped from the scraped GitHub docs because the reusable Ever sessions were expired and the current browser context was not authenticated.

Evidence:
- Ever attempted first as required: `ever snapshot --mode full` failed with `No tab with given id`; `ever use 1 && ever snapshot --mode full` failed with `Session expired`.
- Fallback live browser capture: Chrome headless screenshot saved to `ralph/screenshots/inspect/home-sitemap.jpg`.
- Fallback live DOM capture: GitHub home page global nav/footer links extracted from `https://github.com/`.
- Docs cross-reference: `target-docs/content/account-and-profile/get-started/personal-dashboard-quickstart.md`, `target-docs/content/repositories/index.md`, `target-docs/content/issues/index.md`, `target-docs/content/pull-requests/index.md`, `target-docs/content/actions/index.md`, `target-docs/content/packages/index.md`, `target-docs/content/pages/index.md`, `target-docs/content/organizations/index.md`, `target-docs/content/search-github/index.md`, `target-docs/content/subscriptions-and-notifications/index.md`.

## Global Layout Pattern

- Public logged-out pages use a marketing header with GitHub mark, dropdown mega-nav sections, search/jump control, Sign in link, bordered Sign up button, large hero content, product sections, and dense multi-column footer.
- Signed-in pages use a compact GitHub app shell: left global navigation menu trigger, GitHub mark back to dashboard, global search/jump bar, quick-create button, Issues/Pull requests/Notifications shortcuts, and avatar menu.
- Repository pages are the core workspace. They use an owner/repo breadcrumb header, visibility badge, repository action buttons, and a horizontal tab bar for Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, and Settings.
- List pages use compact filter bars, status tabs, labels/milestones/actions links, query input, and paginated or grouped result lists.
- Settings pages use left sidebar navigation with right-column forms/cards and dangerous actions at the bottom.

## Public / Logged-Out Pages

- `/` — marketing home. Global nav, search field, sign-in/sign-up CTAs, product feature sections, customer stories, footer.
- `/login` — sign-in page inspected in iteration 1.

## Initial Deep-Dive Order

1. Personal dashboard / onboarding empty state. Completed in iteration 3 from docs-backed inspection; live authenticated UI remains blocked by expired Ever session.
2. Repository create/import form group. Completed in iteration 4 with live `/new` form inspection and docs-backed `/new/import` behavior because Ever could navigate to the import tab but could not snapshot/screenshot/extract it.
3. Repository code/file browser. Completed in iteration 5 with live `vercel/next.js` inspection for overview, tree directory, blob view, branch/code controls, and docs-backed clone/raw/blame behavior.
4. Issues list/detail/create. Completed in iteration 6 with live `vercel/next.js` inspection for list, filters, sort menu, label filter menu, filtered query URL, template chooser, issue form, issue detail timeline/comment composer/sidebar, and docs-backed search/template behavior.
5. Pull request list/detail/diff/review. Completed in iteration 7 with live `vercel/next.js` inspection for PR list, sort menu, reviews filter menu, compare/no-diff state, conversation timeline, mergeability/status box, files changed diff, and submit review dialog.
6. Actions workflow runs/logs. Completed in iteration 8 with live `vercel/next.js` inspection for All workflows run list, workflow filter panels, workflow-specific runs, failed run detail, job sidebar, annotations, artifacts, job log view, and log search.
7. Global search/code search. Completed in iteration 9 with live search inspection for repository-scoped code search, qualifier autocomplete, result type menu, saved-search modal, issue search results, issue search sort menu, and docs-backed code search/file finder syntax.
8. User and organization profiles. Completed in iteration 10 with headless Chrome fallback for user overview, user repositories, user stars, org overview, filtered org repositories, and org people list after Ever DOM extraction failed.
9. Repository settings, access, webhooks, Pages. Completed in iteration 11 with docs-backed UI behavior and live `gh api` verification for `namuh-eng/opengithub`; Ever/headless authenticated settings screenshots were blocked.
10. Packages and releases. Completed in iteration 12 with Chrome fallback after Ever snapshot/navigation failures. Covered repository releases list, latest release detail, tags list, organization package filters, npm empty filtered state, and container package detail/install snippets. Create/edit release and package access-control behavior is docs-backed.
